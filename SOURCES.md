## Final Note on Sources

**The most authoritative sources on Wendigo are Algonquian knowledge keepers, elders, and cultural practitioners**—not written texts. Oral tradition and lived cultural practice carry knowledge that written documentation cannot fully capture.

When possible, learn directly from:
- Tribal cultural centers and education programs
- Indigenous scholars from Algonquian communities
- Cultural practitioners and ceremonial leaders
- Elders who carry traditional teachings

Written sources, including this list, can supplement but not replace direct engagement with Indigenous knowledge keepers.
