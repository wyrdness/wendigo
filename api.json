      "full": "The Wendigo (also spelled Windigo, Witiko, Wiindigoo) is a malevolent spirit or supernatural being central to the spiritual traditions of Algonquian-speaking peoples, including the Ojibwe, Cree, Innu, Algonquin, and related nations of northern North America. In traditional teachings, the Wendigo is associated with winter, starvation, greed, and most critically, **cannibalism**—the gravest taboo. A person who resorts to eating human flesh, whether through starvation or choice, may become possessed by a Wendigo spirit or transform into one, developing an insatiable hunger for human flesh that can never be satisfied. The Wendigo grows larger with each victim consumed, yet remains eternally starving."
