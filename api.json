      "summary": "A malevolent spirit or supernatural being from Algonquian spiritual traditions, associated with winter, starvation, and cannibalism. Represents both a literal entity and cultural teachings about the gravest taboo—consuming human flesh during times of famine.",
      "full": "The Wendigo is a deeply significant spiritual concept within Algonquian cultures including the Ojibwe, Cree, Innu, and related nations. Traditionally understood as a malevolent spirit associated with winter, famine, greed, and cannibalism, the Wendigo serves as both a supernatural entity and a powerful cultural teaching about the most serious taboos. In traditional accounts, a person who resorts to cannibalism—whether through starvation or choice—may become possessed by a Wendigo spirit or transform into one, developing an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The Wendigo grows larger with each victim consumed, yet remains eternally starving. This concept reflects the harsh realities of survival in northern winters and the critical importance of maintaining human dignity and cultural values even in the face of starvation. The Wendigo is sacred subject matter representing real historical trauma, spiritual warnings, and survival ethics central to Algonquian peoples."
